## MongoDB Integration Design

### 1. Database Schema

Create the following MongoDB schemas:

a. Subreddit Schema:
- name (String, unique)
- description (String)
- subscribers (Number)
- lastUpdated (Date)

b. Post Schema:
- subredditName (String, index)
- id (String, unique)
- title (String)
- content (String)
- url (String)
- score (Number)
- numComments (Number)
- createdAt (Date)
- analysis (Object)
  - solutionRequests (Boolean)
  - painAndAnger (Boolean)
  - adviceRequests (Boolean)
  - moneyTalk (Boolean)

### 2. API Routes Modification

Update the following API routes to interact with MongoDB:

a. `/api/subreddits/route.ts`:
- GET: Fetch subreddits from MongoDB instead of using mock data
- POST: Save new subreddit to MongoDB

b. `/api/subreddits/[name]/posts/route.ts`:
- GET: Check if posts for the subreddit exist in MongoDB and if they're up-to-date
  - If data is fresh (less than 24 hours old), return from MongoDB
  - If data is stale or doesn't exist, fetch from Reddit API, analyze with OpenAI, save to MongoDB, then return

c. `/api/subreddits/[name]/analyze/route.ts`:
- GET: Fetch analyzed posts from MongoDB
- Implement a background job to periodically update analysis for all subreddits

### 3. Data Fetching and Caching Logic

Create a new file `src/lib/dataFetcher.ts` to handle data fetching and caching logic:

- Implement a function to check if data needs refreshing (> 24 hours old)
- Create functions to fetch and store data in MongoDB
- Implement error handling and logging for database operations

### 4. MongoDB Connection

Create a new file `src/lib/mongodb.ts` to handle MongoDB connection:

- Use MongoDB driver or an ORM like Mongoose
- Implement connection pooling for efficient database access
- Create helper functions for common database operations (e.g., findOne, updateOne, insertMany)

### 5. Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to `.env.local`:

- MONGODB_URI: Connection string for MongoDB database
- DB_NAME: Name of the database to use

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms:

- Create a custom error class for database-related errors
- Implement logging for database operations, especially for errors and performance metrics
- Use a logging library compatible with Next.js (e.g., winston, pino)

### 7. Testing

Develop unit and integration tests for:

- Database connection and operations
- Data fetching and caching logic
- API routes that interact with the database

### 8. Performance Considerations

- Implement indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., subredditName, createdAt)
- Use aggregation pipelines for complex queries, especially for analytics
- Implement pagination for large datasets

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster or local MongoDB instance
2. Install necessary dependencies (MongoDB driver or Mongoose)
3. Implement database connection in `src/lib/mongodb.ts`
4. Create Mongoose schemas or MongoDB collections based on the defined schemas
5. Update API routes to use the new MongoDB integration
6. Implement data fetching and caching logic in `src/lib/dataFetcher.ts`
7. Modify frontend components to handle loading states and potential errors
8. Set up background jobs for data refreshing
9. Implement error handling and logging throughout the application
10. Write tests for the new database integration
11. Update documentation and comments to reflect the new data flow

## Conclusion

This MongoDB integration will significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the Reddit Analytics Platform. By caching data and reducing API calls, the application will be more responsive and cost-effective. The backend engineer should focus on creating a robust and scalable database integration that can handle the dynamic nature of Reddit data while providing fast and reliable access to the frontend components.
