# Caching Implementation for Reddit Analytics Platform using TanStack Query

## Overview

To improve performance and reduce server load, we'll implement a client-side caching mechanism using TanStack Query (formerly React Query). This will allow us to efficiently manage data fetching, caching, and synchronization between the server and client.

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up TanStack Query:
   - Install the necessary packages.
   - Configure the QueryClient with appropriate default options.
   - Wrap the application with QueryClientProvider.

2. Implement query hooks:
   - Create custom hooks for fetching data (e.g., useSubredditPosts, useThemes).
   - Utilize TanStack Query's useQuery hook for data fetching and caching.

3. Update components to use TanStack Query:
   - Modify TopPosts, Themes, and other data-fetching components to use the new query hooks.
   - Leverage TanStack Query's built-in loading, error, and data states.

4. Implement mutations:
   - Create mutation hooks for data updates (e.g., useAddPost, useUpdateSubreddit).
   - Use TanStack Query's useMutation hook for handling data mutations.

5. Configure query invalidation:
   - Implement query invalidation strategies when data is updated.
   - Use queryClient.invalidateQueries() to mark queries as stale after mutations.

6. Optimize data fetching:
   - Implement prefetching for anticipated data needs.
   - Utilize TanStack Query's prefetchQuery method for proactive data loading.

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. TanStack Query Setup

- Configure QueryClient with appropriate staleTime, cacheTime, and refetchOnWindowFocus options.
- Implement persistent caching using TanStack Query's persistQueryClient plugin.

### 2. Query Hooks

- Create hooks that encapsulate the useQuery logic for each data fetching operation.
- Implement proper error handling and loading states within these hooks.

### 3. Component Updates

- Refactor components to use the new query hooks instead of direct API calls.
- Implement optimistic updates for a better user experience during mutations.

### 4. Mutations

- Create mutation hooks for all data modification operations.
- Implement proper error handling and success callbacks for mutations.

### 5. Query Invalidation

- Define a clear strategy for when and how to invalidate queries.
- Use query key prefixes to enable granular and broad invalidation as needed.

### 6. Performance Optimization

- Implement infinite queries for paginated data (e.g., post lists).
- Use TanStack Query's select option to transform and memoize data as needed.

## Best Practices

- Use consistent and hierarchical query keys.
- Leverage TanStack Query's built-in devtools for debugging and monitoring.
- Implement proper TypeScript types for query and mutation results.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for query and mutation hooks.
- Update component tests to account for TanStack Query's behavior.
- Test error handling and loading states provided by TanStack Query.

## Monitoring and Optimization

- Use TanStack Query's built-in retry and refetch mechanisms.
- Monitor query performance using the devtools and adjust configurations as needed.
